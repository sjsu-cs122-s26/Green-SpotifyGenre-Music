# Dataset Overview

The Spotify Tracks Genre Dataset is a tabular collection of audio metadata for
approximately 114,000 Spotify tracks, each labeled with a music genre. It
includes key audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, tempo, loudness),
track metadata (such as track name, artist, album, popularity, duration,
explicit flag), and the genre label for each track. This dataset supports tasks
like genre classification, music analysis, and recommendation system
development based on musical attributes and genres. 

# Installation Instructions

For obvious reasons, the full dataset is not committed to the repository. The
dataset is publicly available on to download on Kaggle
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/spotify-tracks-genre-dataset/data).
It is a single CSV file named `train.csv`. A preview of the dataset is in this
directory containing the first 500 entries named `sample_data.csv`.

Once you have downloaded the dataset, place the file in the `data/` directory
(this directory) of this repository.
